## Poker Game Simulation

We can run the Table.java file to simulate the game where we can start the game by adding players and thier balances.

Once the player is added with his balance, he will be able to see his hole cards(first two cards).

Then players can fold, check or raise a certain amount based on thier cards. Once bets of all players are done, then the flop cards(first three community cards) are shown to the players and the betting starts again.

After second round of betting, the turn card(forth community card) is shown and again betting starts.

Lastly, the river card(last community card) is shown and final round of betting is done.

After it, all players show their cards and the one with the highest ranking according to the rules win the game and total pool amount goes to him.
